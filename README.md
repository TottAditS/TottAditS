<h3>About Game</h3>
Knights N Pong it's a minigame i created using Unity Engine, I'm currently still new to Unity Engine and this is my second project after "MyFirstProject". Just a simple game based on Pong. This game is about two knights having fun passing ball each other.

<h3>Gameplay</h3>
The gameplay of this game is just like a regular pong game, you van move up and down, and aim at the ball. The difference is this game using Healthbar instead of score, so when the bar hit zero, then the player lose.

<h3>About Game</h3>
Agent Zero is a Prototype game themed Natural Disaster, Educational Game. The game for now has two level. And the levels are connected to each other, so what you do on level 1 will have
consequences on another level. This is my third game built using Unity Engine, it's not perfect, still have ups and downs, and i will finish the game soon.

<h3>Gameplay</h3>
The gameplay of this game is side scroll themed. You can move the player left and right, and you can grab and drop trash scatter in the area.
The purpose of this game to make habit, educate that trash, garbages is not something you can ignore. On the second level, earthquake hits, and heavy rain falls.
All you do on the previous level will impact this level, basically, the more trash you ignore, the harder the level gets. But it still on prototype so this feature is still not done.
