### About Me
Hello! I'm a passionate programmer in game development using Unity. Whether it's coding complex AI behaviors or polishing visual effects, I'm constantly pushing the boundaries of what's possible in Unity to bring my ideas to life. I'm currently a student, Faculty of Computer Science, majoring in Game Application and Technology.

Agent Zero is a Prototype game themed Natural Disaster, Educational Game. The game for now has two level. And the levels are connected to each other, so what you do on level 1 will have
consequences on another level. This is my third game built using Unity Engine, it's not perfect, still have ups and downs, and i will finish the game soon.
